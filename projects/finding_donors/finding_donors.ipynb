    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>1. Support Vector Machines (Support Vector Classifier):</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Real world application:</u> Image or Text classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Strengths:</u>\n",
    "* The main reason you would want to use an SVM is because your problem might not be linearly separable. In that case, you will have to use an SVM with a non linear kernel (e.g. RBF).It uses a technique called the kernel trick which can do different complex transformations on your data to help find the optimal boundaries.\n",
    "* Another related reason to use SVMs is if you are in a highly dimensional space. For example, SVMs have been reported to work better for text classification. \n",
    "* Works well on smaller cleaner datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Weaknesses:</u>\n",
    "* As SVM relies on support vectors to determine decision boundaries, a small sample would mean fewer of these for accurate positioning of the boundaries. \n",
    "* SVM is only able to classify two groups at a time. If there are more than two groups, SVM would need to be iterated to distinguish each group from the rest through a technique known as multi-class SVM.\n",
    "* SVM classifies a data point based on which side of the decision boundary it falls on. When a large overlap exists between data points from both groups, a data point near the boundary might be more prone to misclassification.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Candidacy:</u> \n",
    "* Chose SVM as once we used on-hot encoding our number of features dramatically grew. We know SVMs work well on high dimensional data.\n",
    "* Also chose it because the volume of our data set is comparably small.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNeighbors Classifier):</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "<u> Real world application:</u> Recommender Systems. You can classify a population based off their similarities.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Strengths:</u>\n",
    "* It is an easy to understand algorithm.\n",
    "* It works well with a small number of features (low dimensionality).\n",
    "* Can handle large volumes of data\n",
    "    \n",
    "<u>Weaknesses:</u>\n",
    "* Its sensitivity to outliers\n",
    "* Large search problem to find nearest neighbours\n",
    "* Must know we have a meaningful distance function\n",
    "* Need large number of data sets for accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Candidacy:</u> \n",
    "* Chose KNN as it is simple to use even though we have a large number of features\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>3. Ensemble Methods (AdaBoost):</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Real world application:</u> Image detection. For example, identifying a basketball player during a game.\n",
    "    \n",
    "<u>Strengths:</u>\n",
    "* Robust as it uses a collection of several weak classifiers to bring out the best results\n",
    "* Improves classification accuracy\n",
    "* Commonly used in many areas\n",
    "* Simple to implement and fast\n",
    "* Not prone to overfitting\n",
    "    \n",
    "<u>Weaknesses:</u>\n",
    "* Dependent on underlying weak models\n",
    "    \n",
    "<u>Candidacy:</u>\n",
    "* Wanted to see how an ensemble model will provide higher quality results.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>NOTE - I tried five algorithms and received improved results. Decided to comment the last two as the question only needed us to try three models.</b>\n"

    "### Support Vector Machines: \n",
    "##### Reference - Ng, Annalyn. Numsense! Data Science for the Layman: No Math Added. Kindle Edition.\n",
    "* Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifies data points into two groups by drawing a boundary down the middle between peripheral data points (i.e. support vectors) of both groups. \n",
    "* SVM is resilient against outliers as it uses a buffer zone that allows a few data points to be on the incorrect side of the boundary. It also employs the kernel trick to efficiently derive curved boundaries. \n",
    "* SVM works best when data points from a large sample have to be classified into two distinct groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adaboost:\n",
    "##### Reference - https://hackerbits.com/data/adaboost-data-mining-algorithm/\n",
    "* Boosting is an ensemble learning algorithm which takes multiple learning algorithms (e.g. decision trees) and combines them. The goal is to take an ensemble or group of weak learners and combine them to create a single strong learner.\n",
    "* AdaBoost takes a sample of the training dataset and tests to see how accurate each learner is. The end result is we find the best learner.In addition, samples that are misclassified are given a heavier weight, so that they have a higher chance of being picked in the next round.One more thing, the best learner is also given a weight depending on its accuracy and incorporated into the ensemble of learners.\n",
    "* In round 2, AdaBoost again attempts to look for the best learner. And here’s the kicker: The sample of patient training data is now influenced by the more heavily misclassified weights. In other words, previously misclassified patients have a higher chance of showing up in the sample.\n",
    "* At the end of the 10 rounds: We’re left with an ensemble of weighted learners trained and then repeatedly retrained on misclassified data from the previous rounds.\n",
    "* AdaBoost is simple. The algorithm is relatively straight-forward to program.In addition, it’s fast! Weak learners are generally simpler than strong learners. Being simpler means they’ll likely execute faster. Another thing... It’s a super elegant way to auto-tune a classifier, since each successive AdaBoost round refines the weights for each of the best learners. All you need to specify is the number of rounds."

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
